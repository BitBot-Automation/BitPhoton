# Pre-2025 Foreword 
In the past year I had done some work, getting this sensor to report properly, build the firmware and prototyped it on a breadboard, it worked properly (for the most part)
(Images in readme)

Time spent: ~20hrs

# May 24th
I started my PCB design, currently my plan is to make it the smallest it can be and use those pre-made aliexpress modules for the sensor and can module to reduce complexity, the biggest challenge right now i think would be the battery but so far i think it's going fine
